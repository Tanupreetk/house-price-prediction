# House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices using regression techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features like area, quality, number of rooms, and more.

## Project Goals
- Understand feature impact on house prices
- Build a regression model with high accuracy
- Prepare for deployment via Streamlit for easy predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning (Handling missing values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
3. Feature Engineering and Selection
4. Model Training (Linear Regression)
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)
6. Model Saving using `joblib`

## Results
- Final Model: **Linear Regression**
- RMSE: **34,771.85**
- R² Score: **0.85**
